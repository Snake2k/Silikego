The xvcalc_calculate() function returns a status code as a char. The following are currently possible
values:

'e':  Syntax/parse error      -- An error message will be returned by xvcalc_error_message().
'm':  Memory alocation error  -- If this is returned, xvcalc was not able to allocate enough memory
                                 to complete the operation or alocate memory for a syntax error
                                 message.
'i':  Success, int result     -- the result of the calculation will be returned by xvcalc_get_int()
'f':  Success, float result   -- the result of the calculation will be returned by xvcalc_get_float()

Other values may be added in the future.
